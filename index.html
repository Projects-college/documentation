            <p>the term “progressive web apps” to describe apps that, thanks to modern web technologies, are able to provide an improved experience for their users.
                Since then, progressive web applications have gained enough interest and support in the web scene to be considered the state of art of modern web development.</p>
                Advantages of PWAs #

                The Advantages of PWAs include:
                <ul >
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>No dedicated team needed:</strong> The same existing web team can be used to implement a mobile version of the company website or a brand new PWA. This translates to reduced expenses planned for the application. Meanwhile, implementing native apps, using a specific technology stack often requires a dedicated team of developers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Immediately online:</strong> The new version of a PWA can be deployed online at any time without having to fulfill Apple or Play Store checks; they do not run the risk of having the app rejected because some of the requirements are not fulfilled.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Progressive:</strong> If the user has an old browser (e.g., IE 11), the application will still work as a normal web app without delivering any advanced functionality.
                    In this sense, a PWA delivers progressively features to the target system and gracefully skips the unsupported ones.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Only one version to maintain:</strong> There is only one live version available. Therefore, no added complexity for maintaining multiple versions of the app is required.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Responsive:</strong> PWAs fit any device, including desktop, mobile, or tablet, as well as resolution.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Available offline:</strong> Thanks to service workers, <span >it is possible to cache data locally and make it available even without a valid network connection.</span> There are different caching strategies available, and each of them is suited for a specific scenario, which maximizes the performance and response time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Re-engage:</strong> PWAs increase users’ re-engagement through web notifications. They work in the background, allowing you to reach your users even if the application is closed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Installable:</strong> Thanks to the web app manifest, a PWA can be installed on the users’ devices’ home screens.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Small footprint:</strong> PWAs typically have a small size because they use the browser functionality and Web APIs (whenever supported). Therefore, unlike native apps, they don’t require further modules or packages.</p>
                    </li>
                    </ul>

            <p> React is a JavaScript UI development library. It is quite simple, component-based, declarative, and universal. 
                First introduced in May 2013, it has won the affection and love of multiple front-end developers from all over the world. 
                Simple but powerful, it is the most popular JavaScript technology for building user interfaces.
                Armed with the support of a large and active developer community, React is often updated, thoroughly maintained, and learner-friendly.</p>

            <p>
              An application programming interface, is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. 
              It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.

              The Edamam B2B API is accessed by sending HTTPS requests on specific URLs as described below. The base URL is https://api.edamam.com, and you obtain the full URL by appending request’s path to the base URL, for example, https://api.edamam.com/search.
        
              On success, the API returns HTTP code 200 OK and the body contains the result of the query in JSON format. In case of errors, the API returns an error code (e.g. 404 NOT FOUND). 
              The body may contain useful information in HTML format. Client programs should use only the response codes, as the bodies are provided for the convenience of the client developers.
